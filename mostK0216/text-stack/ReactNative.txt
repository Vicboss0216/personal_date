What significant experience do you have in front-end development, particularly on mobile in React Native?✱

I have several years of experience in front-end development, with a strong focus on mobile using React Native. 
I’ve built and maintained production apps for both iOS and Android, implementing features like authentication, push notifications, offline support, and smooth animations. 
I’ve also worked with common libraries like React Navigation, Redux/RTK, and native modules when needed. 
I focus on clean architecture, performance, and delivering a great user experience.
