I have solid experience using React to build modern, responsive web applications. I work with React Hooks for managing state and side effects, use Context API or Redux for global state, and integrate RESTful APIs or GraphQL for dynamic data. I focus on creating reusable components, writing clean and maintainable code, and ensuring good UI/UX. I also use Jest and React Testing Library for testing, and follow best practices for performance optimization and responsive design.
