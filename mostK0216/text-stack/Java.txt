Senior Java Developer with 10+ years of experience in designing and building scalable enterprise web applications. Proficient in full-stack development, API design (RESTful, GraphQL), and microservice architectures. Experienced with Spring, Hibernate, Apache Kafka, and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure). Strong in test-driven development (TDD) and Agile practices, with expertise in Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform for deploying high-availability systems.


I have good experience with Golang. 
I’ve used it to build backend services, APIs (both REST and gRPC), and some internal tools. 
I’ve worked with databases like PostgreSQL using Go, and I’m comfortable with Go’s concurrency features like goroutines and channels. 
I’ve also written tests and used Go in Docker-based deployments. 
While it’s not my main language, I can confidently work with it and pick up new things quickly.
